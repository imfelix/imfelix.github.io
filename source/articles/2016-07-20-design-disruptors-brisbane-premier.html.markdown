It was a Monday. *Maybe some other day, I can't recall.*

I was reading a weekly email digest from Clark, *a.k.a Clark from InVision*. One piece stood out from the newsletter, a documentary film about design â€” Design Disruptors.

Watched the trailer. Extremely excited about it. Have to be on the list to watch the film. I scrolled to the screenings section hoping to find Brisbane on the list. Guess what, we ain't there.
