Have you ever had this urge to do something, then comes along this thought behind your head that tells you.

<em class="grey">‚ÄúForget about it. Nobody cares.‚Äù</em>

But when you are so passionate for what you are about to do. This other thought pops in.

<em class="grey">‚ÄúScrew it. Let's do this.‚Äù</em>

I went through this thought process when I sent out my email to InVision, expressing my interest for a screening of Design Disruptors in Brisbane.

<hr class="dotted-divider">

## Back when it all started

Usual routine ‚Äî checking emails, sipping on coffee.

You've got mail! *Clark from InVision - Weekly Digest.*

</p>

Being the curious person I am, I watched the trailer ‚Äî maybe more times than I liked to admit. The film is a documentary about the impact and importance of design. A glimpse into the secret worlds of well-known designers. Debunking the myths of how they decide on design choices that impact daily lives of billions.

I was so hyped for the film, I told myself that I must watch it. Hoping to find a screening in Brisbane, but there isn't one.

<em class="grey">How is it possible that there is no screening in Brisbane?</em>

<em class="grey">Is no one interested about the film?</em>

Out of no where, I had this crazy thought.

<em class="grey">What if I bring this film to Brisbane?</em>

At that point, I have not thought about the logistics nor if I have any resources to organise such an event. All I wanted to do was to watch the film.

> Don't wait for things to happen and go make them happen.

> <cite>Anonymous</cite>

This quote does sound clich√© but it is true in this case. I didn't wait for someone to organise a screening in Brisbane. Instead, I wrote an email to one of the producers of the film, Clair.

I wasn't expecting Clair to reply anytime soon, but she replied the next day. She wanted know a couple things ‚Äî potential screening locations, screening size, company affiliation, etc.

Then it hit me. I have not thought this through.

<em class="grey">Who can I reach out for help to organise this event?</em>

<em class="grey">MeetUp groups? Universities? Digital agencies?</em>

## Man in the shining armor

I knew there is one person who would definitely help me on this. Bruce, my managing director at NetEngine. He is always encouraging us in the company to contribute back to the community. Plus, one of our company values being **do worthwhile things**. I am sure this event will be a great opportunity for myself and the company to reflect our values.

In the end, Bruce didn't just encourage me to do it, instead he said the company would sponsor the licensing fee of the film. He even got our office marketing champ, Ash to help out.

Being the awesome Ash, she made a few calls and we have [The Design Conference](//thedesignconference.com.au/), [AGDA](//www.agda.com.au/), and [Creative Mornings - Brisbane](//creativemornings.com/cities/BNE) as event partners to promote the event. *Unbelievable*.

## It‚Äôs all about¬†location

Another *magical* email came through. Steve, my lecturer from [University of Queensland](//uq.edu.au/) replied to my email about hosting at the university. He even mentioned the event may be hosted at the GHD Auditorium. This [virtual tour](//s3.uqcloud.net/eait-precinct/AEB/tour.html) ain't even close to what you experience when you're inside.

</p>

Steve got me in contact with the faculty's Marketing & Communication Manager, Trent. He loved the idea and scheduled a meeting with Ash and I to talk over the logistics.

<em class="grey">I can't believe this. It is happening.</em>

In case you're wondering, I have not organised any event before this. Not a clue where to start. I went home that day thinking I need to prepare a sponsor prospectus for the meeting. I didn't even know what a sponsor prospectus is before this. Spent the night googling what is needed in a prospectus. I included video crew, swag bags, food, anything I can think of to make the event awesome.

</p>

We received more than we expected from Trent. *Thanks, Trent*. We got the GHD auditorium, premium catering, ticket system, and a dedicated AV crew for the event. All covered by the courtesy of the university.

The date is set. Location is booked. Tickets are ready for grabs.

Only piece missing from the puzzle. The film.

Just going through some legal stuff with the film. Those things take time. I won't lie, I was worried. To get my mind off it, I focused on something else. Something that I enjoy ‚Äî designing.

## Here comes the website

I drafted a couple of versions for the event website. I went with a one-page website separated into sections. My approach is to emphasise on the film coming to Brisbane, accompany with the theme of Design Disruptors.

<p class="m0">

</p>

I wanted to add some interaction onto the website that goes along with the theme, disrupt. Thus, the idea of disrupting the word Brisbane ‚Äî where the word scrambles when you hover over it. Thanks to the help from my colleague, Adam, the Javascript Wiz. We both dedicated our day to design and develop the website. We even managed to snatch the domain name, [designdisruptors.com.au](//designdisruptors.com.au/).

## How do you promote events these days?

Social media ‚Äî you got that right. It would be a pain to produce event ads for each social platform, not to mention printed materials. Here is where [Outfit](//outfit.io/) gets to shine, a brand automation platform developed by the team at NetEngine. It is a tool where designers can design a layout, and leave the content to organisers. Organisers can focus on the content and not have to worry about messing up the design. Finally, let Outfit deal with the rendering. Speak to [Ash](https://au.linkedin.com/in/ashleighthompson) if you need a demo, it is pretty neat.

## A week before the screening

Coincidentally, I happen to attend the Product Design Brisbane MeetUp group a week before the screening. It was my first time attending this MeetUp group. I was keen to promote the film screening, so I went. Meeting the hosts of the MeetUp, Luke and Jai, I asked if I could make an announcement at the end of the session. They agreed to it not knowing what I was about to announce. When it was time, Jai and I had a quick chat about my announcement. Guess what. Luke and Jai were going to announce that they are hosting a screening of the film as well.¬†

<em class="grey">I was like ‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää dude, no way.</em>

They were at the same stage as I was, waiting for the film. Then Jai said the most amazing thing I can imagine, *‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do it together‚Äù*. Not only Jai helped me out with promoting the event, he also got me in touch with his Creative Director at Josephmark, Alex.

The timing couldn‚Äôt be better. I was looking for one more expert to join the expert panel session, and Alex would be excellent. Together with Steve, my lecturer, and Matt, the founder of The Design Conference chairing the panel, it is going to be epic.

## Finally. It has arrived.

The missing piece. Seriously, I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful for the team at InVision to have send through the film. Everything is in place now. Only 2 days after sending out the ads‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäTrent told us we up to 291 registers. Add up the MeetUp group registers, we have reached the limit. *350 registers* üò±
