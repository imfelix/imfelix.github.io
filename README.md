> This is the final version — said the naive me

After months of telling myself, it is the final version of my portfolio site and I will start building it — which I never did. I have finally started on something. Nothing flashy, fancy, or even colourful — only 5 shades of grey. However, I have put a lot of thought into building this website, check out my list of [considerations](#considerations) below and you'll have an idea.

Happy to hear from you if you have any feedback for my site or even thoughts on my code — anything — just hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/im_felix) or send me an [email](mailto:hello@felixlee.io).

## Considerations

- User experience
  - Navigation — *How should the navigations be positioned?*
  - Width per line — *Keep it short, 11 - 12 words per line*
  - Line height — *Good amount of line-height for reading experience*
  - Font pairing — *This took me a good 3 hours to finalise on Freight Font Family*
- Responsiveness
  - Blog post — *Use border, background color, or separator lines to divide each posts?*
  - Avoid hamburger menu — *Don't hide stuff behind those lines*
- Accessibility
  - Contrast — *Is the contrast AAA compliant?*
  - Icons - *Use words instead of brand icons — unless include screen-read only text*
- Usabilit
  - First time landing on the page, can users find the navigation links?
  - Can they navigate around the site?
- Performance
  - Typekit loading performance - *Have to deal with unloaded fonts*
  - State of the art CSS loading — check out the [article](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/link-in-body/) written by Jake Archibald — *should I do it?*
  - Inline small chunk of CSS in the head — *remove the use of requesting a CSS file at all*
- Use of colours — *My intention is to attempt at designing a website without the use of colours other than shades of grey.*
