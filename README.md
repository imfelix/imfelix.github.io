> This is the final version — said the naive me

After months of telling myself, it is the final version of my portfolio site and I will start building it — which I never did. I have finally started on something. Nothing flashy, fancy, or even colourful — only 5 shades of grey. However, I did put in a lot of thought into building this website, check out my partial-list of [considerations](#considerations) below.

Happy to hear from you if you have any feedback for my site or even thoughts on my code — anything — just hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/im_felix) or send me an [email](mailto:hello@felixlee.io).

## Considerations

- User experience
  - Navigation - *How should the navigations be positioned?*
  - Width of paragraph - *Keep it short, 11 - 12 words per line*
  - Line height - *Good amount of line-height for reading experience*
  - Font pairing - *This took me a good 3 hours to finalise on Freight Font Family*
- Responsiveness
  - Blog post - *Use border, background color, or separator lines to divide each posts?*
  - Avoid hamburger menu - *Don't hide stuff behind those lines*
- Accessibility
  - Contrast - *Is the contrast AAA compliant?*
  - Icons - *Use words instead of brand icons - unless include screen-read text*
- Usability
  - First time landing on the page, can users find the navigation links?
  - Can they navigate around the site?
- Performance
  - Typekit loading performance - *Have to deal with unloaded fonts*
  - State of the art CSS loading - Check out the [article](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/link-in-body/) written by Jake Archibald - *should I do it?*
  - Inline small chunk of CSS in the head - *Remove the use of requesting a CSS file*
- Use of colours - *My intention is to attempt at designing a website without the use of colours other than shades of grey.*
